This project is a nonpartisan, and nonprofit effot to aid in bringing transparency into the activities of the Parliament of India. Much of the legislative data is currently available, but hidden behind the cryptic websites of the Parliament. This is a growing project that aims to make it easier for developers to find and search the data on the Parliament of India, and build beautiful applications on top of it.

The project is currently maintained by [Lokesh Kumar](http://KumarL.github.io), a high on caffeine, and low on morals, sort of a person.
