This project stands on the shoulder of giants.

* The idea, and much of the web application that powers the API, is based of the [Sunlight Congress API](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/) project that provides a wealth of data on US Congress.

* The API serves a lot of data sourced from the [PRS Legislative Research](http://prsindia.org), an independent and non-partisan organization that regularly publishes high-quality content on the activity of the Parliament of India.

[Sansad API](/api/) would not have become a reality without the openness of projects above. In continuing the spirit of openness, all the software that powers the API, and this site, is in the public domain.

You can find the source code for Sansad API at: [github.com/KumarL/sansad](https://github.com/KumarL/sansad). The source code for the webpages is at: [github.com/KumarL/sansad-site](https://github.com/KumarL/sansad-site)
